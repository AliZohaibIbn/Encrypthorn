Introduction

Encrypthorn, I am pretty sure we all have passwords and we almost all the time forget them! so most people just store it in a file to which anyone can access. So instead of storing it in plain text,
so why not use a little practical encryption technique called XOR. Now XOR just finds the bit values and compares, if both the bits are the same the result is 0 if they are different the return value is 1.
So unless you have the same exact key no one can have access to your passwords. At least not for now. But this does not allow you to go on the web and download some malicious files and think that my passwords are
safe.
